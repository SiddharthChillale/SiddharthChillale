📊 **Working Projects Lists**
<!--START_SECTION:waka-->
- &check; - 2D C++ game development [link](https://github.com/SiddharthChillale/snek_game)
  - Wrote a C++ game from scratch featuring a snake who can eat food to grow longer and snacks to move faster. Used WinAPI for window creation and coloring graphics. Implemented primitives like lines, triangles and quads. 
- &check; - Software Ray Tracer [link](https://github.com/SiddharthChillale/Ray_Tracer)
  - wrote a ray tracer following the raytracing series of three books by Peter Shirley. Includes acceleration using bounding volume hierarchical structures of AABBs, volume rendering, direct and indirect light illumination using BRDF model, Texture and image mapping. A Z-Buffer is used to determine the order of drawing overlapping triangles. 
- &check; - DirectX Deferred Rendering [link](https://github.com/SiddharthChillale/cofe-3d-renderer)
  - Developed a 3D renderer using DirectX for deferred rendering. Features dynamic Phong shading with specular highlights, mesh loading, texture mapping with mipmaps, frustum culling. 
- - [ ] - Realtime DirectX Raytracing (limited by hardware)
- - [ ] - Neural Rendering
